# dummyaddition
A dummy package to demonstrate R package creation with emacs ESS

This package does nothing useful. It served a noble purpose, though: It helped us show how an R package is developed with emacs ESS.

## Installation

To install it (are you sure you want to install it? ðŸ¤¨) just use `devtools`:

```r
devtools::install_github("pavodive/dummyaddition")
```
